Homework for Datastructures

CSC 328 – Program 2

Due:	Wednesday March 13, 10 minutes before class starts

Write a program that reads an expression in infix form, converts it to postfix form, and evaluates it.  Your program should handle bad data (including checking if the expression is a valid infix expression).  Use a Stack class, implemented with a linked list, for both the conversion and the evaluation.  A valid expression will contain no spaces, and numbers will only contain one digit.  For example:  (3+7)*2/(7-3).

Expressions will be read from a file named “input.txt”.  Your output should include:
The original expression in infix form
The converted expression in postfix form (or an error message if invalid)
The answer (this step skipped with invalid expressions)
Leave a blank line between problems

What to submit:
Submit source code via email.  If you are absent, it is still your responsibility to submit on time.  Put group members’ last names in the subject line.

Keep in mind the following:
Name your source files stack.h, stack.cpp, and main.cpp.
With invalid data, your program should respond appropriately.
Each function prototype should have a description, preconditions, and postconditions.
Test your code when you think you are finished.  Try to break it.  After you are done trying to break it, I will then try.

Good Luck!  Remember, questions are encouraged.  J
